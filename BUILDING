Project building implemented with qmake subdirs template.

Run /pro/build_subdirs.pro with Qt Creator (QT 5+) and specify prefferable building directory.
It's better to avoid any non-english letters in your paths. My own advice is to create build folder
right near PatterRecognizer folder.

All applications (*.exe), plugins (*.dll; *.dll.a), required resources and runtime libs will be in /bin.

Standalone *.cpp files from /usedsnippets can be compiled with smth like:

C:\Qt\Qt5.3.0\Tools\mingw482_32\bin\g++.exe helloworld.cpp -I"../include" "../lib/*.a" -o hw.exe

Put resulting *.exe file to /bin and it would work.
