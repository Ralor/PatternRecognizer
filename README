OVERVIEW:
    Computer vision and image processing is very interesting field of research, 
	study and business today. PatternRecognizer was implemented as summer 
	internship proposal to software development company named 
	"Rubius" http://rubius.com/about/ which works in that direction.
	
RUNNING:
	Run /bin/PatternRecognizer.exe and load plugins from same folder 
	(for example, /bin/TriangleRecognizer.dll).	All runtime libraries and 
	resources are included.
	
COMPILING:
	- Full Opencv 3.0.0 is included as shared libraries:
	-- /lib folder contains *.dll.a files for static link (they are 
		just pointing to dlls)
	-- /bin folder contains *.dll files for dynamic link
	- Qt 5.3.0 is not fully included, but several required Qt and 
		runtime dlls are in /bin. Source code support only Qt5+ versions.
	- Sources were compiled with mingw:
	-- gcc version: 4.8.2 (i686-posix-dwarf-rev3, Build by MinGW-W64 project)
	-- Target: i686-w64-mingw32
	-- Thread model: posib
