PatternRecognizer 1.0 by

Backlog:
    - User want to recognize contour of circle, rectangle and triangle from loaded jpg, so I'm supposed to design a simple algorithms using appropriate opencv functions.
    - User want a plugin system, so I need to find some kind of architectural pattern and C++ plugins library/mechanism.
    - User want to adjust contour width and color, so there must be some kind of standart dialog window to do that and some standart painting functions.

Features:
    > render image in Qt GUI
    >> set up treshold adjustment
    >> paint static line on image
    >> provide customization for line width and color
    
    > find patterns on jpg using specified treshold
    >> parse file name
    >> find count of patterns on image

Waiting:
    - render binary ovencv image (after tresholding) on qt window
    - remember standart qt elements: adjuster, textedit, label, button, openfile dialog, color dialog
    - find appropriate GoF pattern for plugins
    - find library/mechanism for plugin loading
	- find an algorithm for circle
    - find an algorithm for triangle
	- find an algorithm for rectangle
	- make successful attempt of tresholding and displaying the result with highgui
	
WIP:
	- create makefil/*.pro or smth that compiles helloworld
    -- compile opencv using cmake and WITH_QT = 1 option (what that means?) (to get *.lib)
    
DONE:
    - install opencv
